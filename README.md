# TweakerPrices
Simple python project to get price lists from tweakers in CSV format

# About
This repository is for the development of this program, if you want to use the program without having to deal with any of this
just download the bin folder and run the executable.

# How to use
To use the program put a CSV file in the 'Input' folder. This should be in the same format as the example file. You can't put multiple files in yet.

After running the program and watching it scrape, you will find the output in the 'Output' folder. That should be all you need!
